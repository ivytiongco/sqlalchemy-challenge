# Project Background

Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Then design a Flask API based on the queries developed.

## Analysis

Jupyter notebook "climate.ipynb" contains analysis for the following:
* Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration
  ** Precipitation Analysis
  ** Station Analysis
* Bonus
  ** Temperature Analysis I
  ** Temperature Analysis II
  ** Daily Rainfall Average (partial analysis)

Python file "app.py" is used to create Flask API for:
* Step 2 - Climate App

SQLite file "hawaii.sqlite" is included in this repo and was used in the jupyter notebook.
